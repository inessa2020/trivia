# trivia
For my project, I created my own version of the game Trivia. 

I decided to base my game around music using an API that has questions, mostly about "nostalgic" songs and artists. 

###User Stories
- As a trivia user, I want to know if I got the question right, so that I know if I know the topic.
- As a trivia user, I want questions that make me think, so that I stay interested.
- As a competitive user, I want to score points, so that I know I can win.
- As an active user, I want to be able to start with some easier questions, so that I can warm up.

###MVP Goals
- For a question, you can click the answer. It will tell you if you were right.
- A "You Win" screen at a certain number of points.

####Stretch Goals
- Keeps score between 2 players.
- Timer
- Sound- Learn to either add music to the page or add sound effects to correct/wrong questions
- Press a button for an easy, medium, or hard question. (For now, the game only has "easy")
